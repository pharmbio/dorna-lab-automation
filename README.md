# dorna-lab-automation
Server and WebGUI for Dorna control, built for the Laboratory Automation in Life Sciences course.

This project is split up into two parts:

## /web
The WebGUI built with React


## /server
A flask server that communicates with the Dorna API


## Installation

Requirements are mainly NodeJS, the Dorna API and a few python packages.
I suggest using `venv` to install both the API and packages, making the install portable and not disturbing any already existing libraries.


## Usage



## Calibration
